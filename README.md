# üìä Data Mining Projects

A collection of Jupyter Notebook projects from my Data Mining course. Each project explores a key machine learning technique‚Äîclassification, regression, or clustering‚Äîusing real-world datasets.

### üìù Projects

1. **[PCOS Detection (Classification)](https://sites.google.com/charlotte.edu/maesportfolio/home)**  
   Built classification models to detect Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) using clinical and hormonal data.  
   Focused on features like BMI, age, LH/FSH ratio, and follicle counts to predict PCOS diagnosis.

2. **[Wine Quality Classification](https://sites.google.com/charlotte.edu/predictingwinequality/home)**  
   Used classification algorithms to predict wine quality categories based on physicochemical properties.  
   Compared model performance across decision trees, random forest, and logistic regression.

3. **[Wine Quality Prediction (Regression)](https://sites.google.com/charlotte.edu/wine-quality-prediction/home)**  
   Applied linear regression to predict wine quality scores on a scale from 0 to 10.  
   Analyzed feature importance and evaluated model accuracy with different preprocessing steps.

4. **[Tourism and Economic Impact (Clustering)](https://sites.google.com/charlotte.edu/tourism-and-economic-impact/home)**  
   Clustered countries based on tourism statistics and economic indicators.  
   Used unsupervised learning to uncover patterns and visualize groupings using K-Means.
